spoiler: The purpose of this devblog
---

### Past
Around 2022, I started blog.briannoriega.com. At the time, the purpose was to post progress on software engineering projects and personal goals set for myself. Somewhere along the way, the posts became a bit too personal-leaning, where I had to step away for a time.

### Now
In 2025, I'm reviving the software/engineering side of things through this "dev" blog. I took inspiration from overreacted.io (and if you look at the source, it's currently identical to this). 

Over time, I'll customize the styling to fit more of my aesthetic. But to 'get it out the door' and restart writing about my engineering journey, I had to start somewhere. Why not it be from one of the core contributors of react. ðŸ˜€


#### This Platform

Choosing a new blog platform was a (longer-than-necessary) journey of experimenting with different templates and blogging platforms.

I broke it down to a few things I wanted:

* Articles can be easily editable
* Articles are able to transfer between platforms
* A platform where I understand behind the scenes
* Something other than WordPress or hosted somewhere else

I found Markdown / MDX to be the standard when it came to a file type that fit my needs. I started on Contentful, SQL-based templates, Tumblr, Notion, but found something was missing. After browsing overreacted.io's source, I found a Next.js and Markdown structure that both matches what I want and is easy to understand.

### Future

The posts will come, and I will eventually be on a schedule posting new articles. I will also be reviving old projects (that I've been working behind the scenes) and providing updates as time goes by. 

Note: As far as the personal goals I set in 2022, I kept those achievements within the confines of my photo reels. Maybe one day I'll post those on my revamped personal blog (TBD).  

Stay tuned.
